# Covid-19 Bank loans based off yelp reviews

#Introduction & Goals

A lot of great business are struggling with Covid-19. 
The normal business loan process need to adjust so that great business do not get lumped in with average or mediocre business. 
The loans made to great business would return higher yield, based off return and survival rate. 
Companies that takes advange of qualitative factors could outperform competitors.
The problem is having a measuable factor to determin the quality of the business.

One solution could be to compare small business against each other based on similar industries and proximity.
Giving the loan canadate a qualitative ranking to measure reputation capital to the lending decision. 
For example, if a small restraunt has built up years of reputation as having great food. It should have a high rating along with high count of reviews. 
And if that same restraunt needed a loan to survive or expand then it would be a great canadate for repayment and survival. 
Vs a new restraunt that did not get a chance to build their reputation or an establish restraunt that serves mediocore food. 
Their chance of survival and repayment is less likely. 

	To get the reviews and industry I used Yelp's Data Base 
	Using: PYTHON, JSON, SQL, Spark, Tableua, Hadoop, HDFS, HBASE, HIVE, PIG, Data Wearhouse, Altry, Xylan, AWS, API, Lambda, Kinzta

	By comparing the business a great loan candate could be a business in the top bracket for reputation capital. 
	Under normal circumstance they may not need the money, however because certain industries are effected more. 
	They may come out of this better, as competition struggle to survive more than great businesses.
